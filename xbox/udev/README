The file in this directory is a udev rule to give all users read/write access to xbox
controller input devices.

This is necessary to allow non-root users access to the devices.

If you choose to use this file to allow the xbox library to be used by non-root users, it should
be copied into /etc/udev/rules.d/

If that directory doesn't exist, then udev is not installed on your system, and this file will
be of no use.
